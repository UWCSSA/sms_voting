#SMS Voting 2

===

* This is a Real-Time SMS Voting System. This system was used during the singing competition hosted by University of Waterloo Chinese Student and Scholar Association. 

* Since I only had a bit more than 1 week to make everything works, there are many flaws in the system. However, I did my best to make the system flexible and easy to maintain.

* The system can collect realtime voting from audiences(In this case, since we decided to use Nexmo, the Twilio parser might not work as expected.) and compile a statistics when client-side(which is also a HTML page) asks for it via AJAX.

* The system can be controlled by a backend control panel via REST APIs.

* app.js is the main entry of the backend server. 

* `/panel` contains backend control panel. It was written in HTML 5 and Bootstrap Framework.

* `/verifyNumber` contains a simple webpage that allows audiences to check if their phone number if successfully registered. We don't want to send a message back to user, because it seems Nexmo sometime cannot deliver messages back to users. And I'd rather had no feedback than false feedbacks.

Backend of the system, including control panel and `verifyNumber` was developed by Collin Zhang.
